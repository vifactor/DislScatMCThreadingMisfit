This is the program to calculate X-ray diffraction 
from an epitaxial sample containing threading and misfit dislocations
by means of the Monte Carlo method.

Misfit dislocations can be taken into account both by full Monte Carlo procedure
and by means of approximate correlation function. Threading dislocations are 
taken into account by full Monte Carlo method only.

Three possible experimental geometries are implemented: skew (double- and triple crystal)
and coplanar geometry.
